# automate-hist-rewr
target market ... beginner devs. 

## This application 
1) creates a new repo. 
2) does no destruction 
3) and automates stuff 
4) not allowing the user to manually perform
5) things they should never do.


## The arguement against... 
1) use a different tool.
2) This is a github problem and a gitlab problem let them fix that.

## response: 
1) their fixing it is out of my control. 
2) Defaults hold a ranking in my mind. Custom ways exist to still track file history but they must be learned. Because the website is what is given out of the box. Let me just fix it for them. 

## Current situatiion to access old history really a problem?
1) path step 1 .. ** to do **
2) path step 2 .. ** to do **

## Definately a problem on these website.
1) do me a favor go to your largest repo. 
2) mkdir testyyy_folder
3) mv "file you commit often" testyyy_folder
4) click the file on webpage.
5) click history button.
6) ohhhhhh no! what happened to all my history!
